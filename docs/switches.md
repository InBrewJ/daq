### External and Physical switches.

See the <a href="https://github.com/faucetsdn/faucet/tree/master/docs/vendors">Faucet vendor-specific docs</a>
for how to setup hardware for testing. Some convenience scripts:

* <code>bin/external_ovs</code> sets up an external (to daq) ovs instance for testing stacked configurations.
* <code>bin/physical_sec</code> sets up a physical secondary switch for proper hardware testing.
